### if I am a medical student, how do I end up having a GitHub account?
Many people ask me this question. I started coding when I was 9 years old as a way to manipulate the source code of some game I had back then installed on my PC. I have learned to program from pre-recorded video lectures and with the help of some tutorials available in some forums.

Since then I have fallen in the love of software development, and after that, I have participated in my local competitions such as the Syrian Olympiad of Informatics where I have several medals, as well as some international competitions such as the ACM Arabian Collliagate Programming Contest, where I have represented Syria in 2014 competition held in Eygpt.
